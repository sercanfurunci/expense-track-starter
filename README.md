### Frontend

```bash
npm install
```

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```env
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

```bash
npm run dev       # http://localhost:5173
npm run build     # production build
npm run lint      # ESLint
```

### Backend

```bash
cd src/backend
npm install
```

Create `src/backend/.env`:

```env
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
ADMIN_SECRET=your_admin_secret
RESEND_API_KEY=your_resend_api_key
MAIL_FROM=noreply@yourdomain.com
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_api_key
BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:3000
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:5173
DB_HOST=your_neon_host

DB_NAME=your_db_name
DB_PASSWORD=your_db_password
DB_PORT=5432
```

```bash
node server.js    # http://localhost:3000
